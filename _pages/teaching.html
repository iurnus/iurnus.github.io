I was a teaching assistant at Virginia Tech for several cources: 
* Applied Numerical Methods
* Marine Engineering
* Computational-Based Design of Ocean Structures
* Vehicle Vibration and Control  

As a project scientist, I am not teaching any courses now, but I am teaching
others using the coupled ocean-atmosphere model **SKRIPS**. 

I also taught graduate students and undergraduate students to use my sediment
transport model **sediFoam**. Shanlin Xu published a few papers using
**sediFoam** and now she becomes a faculty member of Zhejiang Institute of
Technology.
