I am an oceanographer studying the ocean processes that occur on different
spatial and temporal scales. My research focuses on air--sea interactions, but
I am also interested in ocean surface waves, atmospheric rivers, sea-ice, and
sediment transport. 

I am developing innovative numerical models to study the ocean. I am the
developer of the regional coupled model
[SKRIPS](https://github.com/iurnus/scripps_kaust_model) and the sediment
transport model [sediFoam](https://github.com/xiaoh/sediFoam). 

I am currently an assistant project scientist at [Scripps Institution of
Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/). I got my Ph.D. from the Department of
Aerospace and Ocean Engineering at [Virginia Tech](https://www.aoe.vt.edu/).
