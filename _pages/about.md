I study the ocean processes that occurs on different spatial and temporal
scales, including air--sea interactions, ocean surface waves, atmospheric
rivers, data assimilation, and sediment transport. I am developing innovative
numerical models to study the ocean.

I am the developer of the regional coupled model
[SKRIPS](https://github.com/iurnus/scripps_kaust_model) and the sediment
transport model [sediFoam](https://github.com/xiaoh/sediFoam).

I am currently an assistant project scientist at [Scripps Institution of
Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/). 

Here is my [google scholar
